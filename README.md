# kanata-capslock

This repository contains my **Kanata configuration** to remap **Caps Lock** on my system.  
Currently, Caps Lock is mapped to a window manager function (Alt+F6 for me), but it can be easily customized.

## Installation

1. Install Kanata: [https://github.com/jtroo/kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)  
2. Copy the config to `~/.config/kanata/config.kbd`.  
3. Start Kanata or set it up as a systemd service (see Kanata documentation).
